## 🌟 Overview

**KrishiMarg** combines the power of **AI, Machine Learning, and Geospatial Intelligence**  
to create a smart ecosystem for **agriculture logistics**, **crop advisory**, and **route planning**.  

It helps farmers, transporters, and distributors optimize:
- **Farm-to-Market routes**
- **Fertilizer and crop delivery paths**
- **Resource allocation**
- **Yield prediction and advisory**
